title: '[CQRS Journey] Journey 4 : Extending and Enhancing the Orders and Registrations Bounded Context'
layout: post
categories: cqrs

## Changes to the bounded context 
- topics
  - Improvements to the way message correlation works with the RegistrationProcessManager class
  - Implementing a record locator to enable a registrant to retrieve an order that she saved during a previous session
  - Adding a countdown timer to the UI to enable a registrant to track how much longer they have to complete an order
  - Supporting orders for multiple seat types simultaneously
  - CQRS command validation

#### Working definitions for this chapter
- Command
  - A request for the system to perform an action that changes the state of the system
  - A single recipient processes a command
  - Sending a command is an asynchronous operation with no return value. 
- Event
  - Event describes something that has happened in the system, typically as a result of a command
  - Multiple subscribers can handle a specific event
- Process manager
  - Process manager coordinates the behavior of the aggregates in the domain
  - The process manager does not contain any business logic, only logic to determine the next command to send

#### User stories 
- Implement a login using a record locator 
- Tell the registrant how much time remains to complete an order 
- Enable a registrant to create an order that includes multiple seat types 

#### Architecture

## Patterns and concepts

#### Record locators
The system needs to be able to retrieve order information quickly based on the registrantâ€™s email address and access code

#### Querying the read side 
To minimize the work that the queries on the read side must perform, these SQL views provide a denormalized version of the data

###### Storing denormalized views in a database

###### implementing the ViewRepository class
- Using the IQueryable interface
```cs
var ordersummary = repository.Query<OrderSummary>().Where(LINQ query to retrieve order summary); 
var orderdetails = repository.Query<OrderDetails>().Where(LINQ query to retrieve order details);
```
  - Simplicity
    - This approach uses a thin abstraction layer over the underlying database
  - Testability
    - You can use LINQ to Objects for mocking
- Using non-generic DAOs
```cs
var ordersummary = dao.FindAllSummarizedOrders(userId); 
var orderdetails = dao.GetOrderDetails(orderId);
var ordersummary = OrderSummaryDAO.FindAll(userId); 
var orderdetails = OrderDetailsDAO.Get(orderId);
```
  - Simplicity 
    - Dependencies are clearer for the client
  - Flexibility 
    - The Get and Find methods hide details
      - the partitioning of the data store
      - the data access methods such as an object relational mapping
      - This makes it easier to change these choices in the future
  - Performance 
    - You can easily optimize the queries that the Find and Get methods run
  - Testability 
    - It is easier to specify unit tests for the Find and Get methods than to create suitable unit tests for the range of possible LINQ queries that a client could specify
  - Maintainability 
    - All of the queries are defined in the same location, the DAO classes, making it easier to modify the system consistently

#### CQRS command validation 
- error
  - retrying the operation
- business failure
    - A business failure should have a predetermined business response
    - If the system cannot reserve a seat because there are no seats left, then it should add the request to a wait list
